        <h3>Q: But wait, I'm interested in learning about NFTs! What's the craze? </h3>

    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
        <p>A: Did you ever get those ads that claimed things like "own a piece of the galaxy! Get a star named after you" or "own your very own piece of a Scottish castle"? Well NFTs are basically that. You pay real US dollars for a digital currency, typically Ethereum. Your Ethereum goes towards one of three things:</p>
        <ol>
         <li>(~85%) to the creator of the NFT. </li>
         <li>(~5%) Paying for computers all around the world to consume electricity to verify the transaction. </li>
         <li>(~10%) The auction house facilitating the transaction. </li>
        </ol>
        <p> In some sense, you are paying to waste electricity, give money to an auction house, and support the creator, who may be anyone from a struggling artist to someone (like me) who knows how to set up a script to automatically generate a digital asset. </p>
        <p> But what do you get in exchange? You can say you own a thing. But suppose the original creator decided to suddently make another, identical NFT, or license that work of art to someone else? Are you protected at all? No. </p>

        <p> However, you do own <i>that particular NFT</i>. Maybe you could sell it again for a higher price. And some people have. But that relies on what's called the Greater Fool Theory. You gotta find a rube who is willing to pay more than you, plus the ~15% cost of the marketplace.</p>
        <h3> In Conclusion </h3>
        <p> Many of you took me at my word, even on April Fools day. I thank you for that trust. In my somewhat educated opinion I believe NFTs are mostly a pyramid scheme. That doesn't mean some people won't make money off them or they provide utility to some people. I also might be completely wrong. This is not financial advice. </p>
        <p> But what I am sure of is text I wrote below is complete balderdash. I wrote a bunch of half-baked buzzwords strung together. Unfortunately, it requires a nontrivial amount of effort to separate something legitimate from something useless. </p>

		<h1> How It Works </h1>
		<p> MetNFT leverages nonfungible tokens to train a deep neural network... entirely on the blockchain. The best part is the entire computation of each neural network is done entirely on the ethereum blockchain, giving the world's first truly decentralized neural net. Through proprietary algorithmic techniques and use of the bleeding-edge bfloat16 format, we are able to decrease storage and computation by over 90%. This allows us to keep the cost of storing our neural networks on the blockchain at a manageable 320,000,000 gas. </p>
